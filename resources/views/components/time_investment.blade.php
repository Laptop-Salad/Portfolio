            I have experimented with habit trackers and productivity apps for years but I have found the most motivating thing to
            be seeing the result of my efforts. Hence, this app.

            TimeInvestment works using a ROI (Return on investment) system. You log what you have done, how many hours it took and
            later in the future you can log the result of that action.

            Currently TimeInvestment is only a web app but I am working on making a PWA out of it to be able to be used offline
            on any mobile device.
