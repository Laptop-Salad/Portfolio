            I frequently make small applications that require a backend and typically I use Laravel + Livewire but I always feel its a
            bit much for something small and I have always had a strong desire to understand frameworks. Especially since I work with them
            pretty much every day.

            CapybaraPHP is a full-stack PHP framework that is currently at version 0.1. It is designed to be very opinionated but very easy
            to setup and use. It comes with its own templating engine CapyView and just like Livewire is designed to remove the need for
            JavaScript.
