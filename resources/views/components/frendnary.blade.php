            <p>
                This project is a collaborative dictionary. It came about because my friends and
                I tended to come up with a lot of definitions for things and we kept them in the
                description of our group chat. Except its grown incredibly long and Im not sure when we will hit the word limit.
                But more than that, it holds a lot of memories and references to different times in our lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project initially was ready to go until I realised that I was not quite taking
                advantage of the framework (Laravel) that I was using and my life would have been
                made 100x easier had I done so.
            </p>

            <p>
                So the project has been rewritten from scratch and I expect to start development
                again in July 2024.
