            <p>The goal of this project is to be able to drag and drop components, kind of like in Figma and be able to get the code for a website instantly!</p>

            <p>
                This project may not even deserve a spot in my portfolio as it has not even begun.
                Well the project has started, however, the core part or the main part of the project which is the drag and drop functionality has had some difficulties.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I was building it out I realised that the complicated thing with this project is the drag and drop functionality and
                state management for those components. I felt it was best to make this part its own project and use it as part of the web builder.
                Mainly, for reusability and abstracting away complicated logic.
            </p>

            <p>I plan on continuing development of this sometime around August-September 2024.</p>
